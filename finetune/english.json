Let's derive the quadratic formula step by step using Sri Lankan O/L Math conventions. üìà\n\nStarting with the general quadratic equation:\n\n\\[ ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \\]\n\n1. **Divide by \\(a\\)** (assuming \\(a \\neq 0\\)):\n\n\\[ x^2 + \\frac{b}{a}x + \\frac{c}{a} = 0 \\]\n\n2. **Rearrange**:\n\n\\[ x^2 + \\frac{b}{a}x = -\\frac{c}{a} \\]\n\n3. **Complete the square**:\n\n\\[ x^2 + \\frac{b}{a}x + \\left(\\frac{b}{2a}\\right)^2 = -\\frac{c}{a} + \\left(\\frac{b}{2a}\\right)^2 \\]\n\n4. This simplifies to:\n\n\\[ \\left(x + \\frac{b}{2a}\\right)^2 = \\frac{b^2 - 4ac}{4a^2} \\]\n\n5. Taking the square root of both sides:\n\n\\[ x + \\frac{b}{2a} = \\pm \\frac{\\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\n6. Finally, solving for \\(x\\):\n\n\\[ x = -\\frac{b}{2a} \\pm \\frac{\\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nCombining gives:\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nAnd there you have it! The derivation of the quadratic formula. Easy peasy, right? üòÑ Got anything else to ask?"
